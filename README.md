# 🐞 Bug Bounty

**Bug Bounty** is a collaborative platform where developers of all levels can find and solve real-world bugs submitted by companies. It serves as a marketplace that incentivizes learning and contribution through a challenge-based reward system.

## 🚀 Overview

Bug Bounty connects developers eager to grow their skills with companies seeking to crowdsource bug resolutions. Developers can browse, claim, and solve bugs for rewards, while companies gain access to a talented pool of problem-solvers.

## How to run

You will need docker. Docker desktop doesn't work on our work laptops, but you can get [Docker Engine through WSL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
Once you have that, from WSL, run `docker compose up --build`. This will run both the frontend and backend at the same time.
This [Docker compose video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTXfR76WmCw) explains it well if you want to look into it.
